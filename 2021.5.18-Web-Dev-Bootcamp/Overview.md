Here is a much more detailed breakdown of the new course curriculum:

*The course has been completely overhauled, with 500+ brand new lectures and 80+ new coding exercises. When I say overhauled, I mean that the entire course and every original video has been redone. The course still focuses on same general topics (HTML, CSS, JS, Node, etc) but everything now uses the latest features and syntax in 2020.*

*The HTML content now includes a stronger emphasis on semantic elements and modern markup. The CSS portion of the course has been expanded, and now covers many topics including flexbox, responsive design, animations, transforms, and more.*

*The JavaScript portion of the course has been dramatically expanded (it's now twice as long) and covers all the newest features in the language (rest, spread, arrow functions, destructuring, etc). The new course also includes a new focus on asynchronous JavaScript (promises, async/await, etc.) and the inner-workings of JavaScript. The course also now includes a section on AJAX and making client-side HTTP requests, which the original course did not cover.*

*The 2nd half of the course is focused on back-end development using Node and Express JS. This portion of the course has been expanded (from 10 hours to 30 hours) and now goes into way more detail on topics including routing, error handling, defining middleware, design patterns, cookies, sessions, defining APIs and more.*

*The course now includes a heavier focus on databases and the differences between SQL and noSQL databases like Mongo. We dive deeper into Mongo DB and learn to write complex queries that the original course omitted. The new course also covers advanced Mongoose ODM topics including virtual properties and database middleware.*

*Another brand-new section is "Authentication From Scratch", where we cover topics like hashing functions, password salting, and the inner workings of authentication. Also new to the course is a section covering security and common vulnerabilities including SQL/Mongo Injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS). We also cover topics like Sanitizing HTML and Mongo, and configuring Content Security Policy Headers.*

*The most notable change is perhaps the brand new massive app we build together throughout the course. This app gives us a chance to incorporate all the concepts we cover in the course, but it's also an opportunity to include more advanced features like image upload, cloud storage, and maps.*

*Overall, this new version of the course is a modernized and more in-depth version of the original course. I'm really excited for students new and old to check it out!*
